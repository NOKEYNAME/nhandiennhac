  <name>SongRec</name>
  <summary>An open-source, unofficial Shazam client for Linux, written in Rust.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from an arbitrary audio file.</p>
    <p>- Recognize audio from the microphone.</p>
    <p>- Usage from both GUI and command line (for the file recognition part).</p>
    <p>- Provide an history of the recognized songs on the GUI, exportable to CSV.</p>
    <p>- Continuous song detection from the microphone, with the ability to choose your input device.</p>
    <p>- Ability to recognize songs from your speakers rather than your microphone (on compatible PulseAudio setups).</p>
    <p>- Generate a lure from a song that, when played, will fool Shazam into thinking that it is the concerned song.</p>

        <p>Add a Catalan translation (thanks to @pgiuli in issue #23)</p>
        <p>Make the UI more clear so that it is visible that we are toggling the recognition from the speakers rather than the microphone when the monitor mode is on (see issue #149)</p>
        <p>Fix a bug that had certain strings to be mistakenly copied at the bad places in the internationalized versions of the application, due to the fuzzy mode of msgmerge/gettext</p>
        <p>Update the Dutch translation (thanks to @Vistaus in PR #150)</p>
        <p>Update compilation instructions in the README.md file</p>

    <release version="0.4.0" date="2023-12-24">
      <description>
        <p>Use libpulse (when available) for displaying the list of selectable audio input devices by default, instead of alsalib for listing audio inputs and pactl for switching to a monitor mode device, so that the list of devices displays correct values on PipeWire/PulseAudio-based systems.</p>
        <p>Make the dependencies over libpulse and DBus MPRIS fully optional, through Cargo features.</p>
        <p>Disable MPRIS signalling in default builds, as it may interfer inopportunely with media keys control from other media players (as submitted in issue #89)</p>
        <p>Fix build issues on non-Linux platforms (thanks to pull request #144 from @dotX12)</p>

        <p>Add safety checks in order to prevent potential crashes when handling corrupt configuration files or invalid audio devices.</p>
        <p>Change the path of the files saving user interface-related preferences in order to update a deprecated Rust crate (this may create a symbolic link from "~/.local/share/songrec" towards an preexisting "~/.local/share/SongRec" directory under Linux).</p>

        <p>- Allow exposing song metadata through the standard DBus MPRIS interface (thanks to @Hummer12007).</p>
